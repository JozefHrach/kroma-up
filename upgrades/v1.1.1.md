## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-geth`, `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_GETH=v0.3.0
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.1.1
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.1.1
```

In this upgrade, a flag name of the op-node has been changed.
- `NODE_SYNCER_L1_CONFS` -> `NODE_VERIFIER_L1_CONFS`

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator up -d
```
