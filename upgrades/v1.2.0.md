# Kroma `v1.2.0` Upgrade Instructions

This document provides instructions to upgrade from Kroma `v1.1.1` to `v1.2.0`.
For more details about `v1.2.0`, please refer the [release note](https://github.com/kroma-network/kroma/releases/tag/v1.2.0).
This upgrade includes upstream of Optimism [`v1.3.0`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-node%2Fv1.3.0).
This upgrade includes Canyon hardfork, so all full nodes and validators must complete the upgrade before the Canyon 
upgrade is activated.

The scheduled activation time of Canyon on Kroma sepolia is `Wed Feb 14 2024 08:00:00 GMT+0000`.

## Guides for upgrade

### Stop Kroma

For upgrade, stop your Kroma full node or validator.
```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode down

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator down
```

### Common

You need to update your `.env` file.

First, update the tag of `kroma-node` and `kroma-validator` docker image.
```
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_GETH=v0.4.2
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_NODE=v1.2.0
IMAGE_TAG__KROMA_VALIDATOR=v1.2.0
```

Also, additional fields are added to `rollup.json`. Please check your `rollup.json` and make sure that the following 
fields are added appropriately. You can also refer the modified [`rollup.json`](../config/sepolia/rollup.json).

```json
{
  "regolith_time": 0,
  "canyon_time": 1707897600
}
```

### Start Kroma

You can now start Kroma full node or validator with a new version.

```bash
# for full node
docker compose --profile fullnode up -d

# for validator
docker compose --profile validator up -d
```
